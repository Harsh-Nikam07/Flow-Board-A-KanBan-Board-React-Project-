# 🛠️ Flow Board (In Progress)
**Flow Board** is a Kanban-style application that I'm currently building to streamline workflow operations. The goal is to provide a visual interface for tracking tasks, prioritizing workloads, and boosting team productivity.

## 🚀 Planned Features
- **Drag-and-Drop Tasks:** Move tasks between columns to reflect their current status.
- **Customizable Boards:** Create, edit, and delete boards and columns tailored to your workflow.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Keep teams in sync with live task updates.
- **Progress Tracking:** Visualize the entire workflow at a glance for better project management.
